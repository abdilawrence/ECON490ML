## Introduction

For our Final Project, we will be attempting to predict the yield of wild blueberries. These are known as "lowbush berries", which grow on low-level bushes and are typically pea-sized. Our dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/wild-blueberry-yield-prediction . This data was generated by a simulation model called the Wild Blueberry Pollination Model, which has been validated by experimental data collected in the State of Main over the last 30 years.

Generally, in the field of agriculture, an increasing quantity of research has gone underway to understand the determinants of crop yield. Machine learning has enabled scientists and farmers to investigate which factors have the greatest impact on crop yield. In this specific case, the crop of interest is the wild blueberry. The paper for which this data was created is called "Simulation-based modeling of wild blueberry pollination". It was published in the January 2018 version of *Computers and Electronics in Agriculture*. The paper can be found at: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169916310274?via%3Dihub .

## Handling Data

Below the dataset will be loaded from a .csv file. The `tidyverse` library has been loaded so that the data will automatically be loaded as a tibble, which provides some advantages over a standard data frame. One advantage being that the `read_csv` function will automatically assign types to each column in the tibble.

```{r, eval = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
data = read_csv("blueberryData.csv")
colnames(data)
dim(data)

```

The dataset contains 18 columns and 777 observations. Along with downloaded the dataset from Kaggle, we downloaded the descriptions of the predictor variables in the dataset.
